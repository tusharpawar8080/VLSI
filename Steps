VLSI Practical Steps (Using Xilinx ISE for Spartan-6)
Software Required:

Xilinx ISE Design Suite (e.g., 14.7)

Target Device: XC6SLX9 (Spartan-6)

Language: VHDL

🔹 Practical 1 to 4 General Steps
Step 1: Create a New Project

Open Xilinx ISE Design Suite.

Go to File → New Project.

Enter the Project Name: ret (or as per your experiment).

Choose a Project Location (e.g., D:\VLSI_LAB\RET).

Under Project Settings:

Family: Spartan-6

Device: XC6SLX9

Package: TQG144 (or as per your kit)

Speed: -2 or -3

Preferred Language: VHDL

Click Next → Finish.

Step 2: Create a New VHDL Module

In the Hierarchy (Implementation) window, right-click the project name →
Select New Source → choose VHDL Module → Next.

Enter the File Name (e.g., and_gate.vhd or full_adder.vhd).

Define entity (inputs/outputs) as per your circuit:

Example for AND gate:

entity and_gate is
   Port ( A : in STD_LOGIC;
          B : in STD_LOGIC;
          Y : out STD_LOGIC);
end and_gate;


Click Next → Finish.

Step 3: Add the VHDL Code

Open the newly created VHDL file.

Write your behavioral code in the architecture section.

Example:

architecture Behavioral of and_gate is
begin
  Y <= A and B;
end Behavioral;


Save the file (Ctrl + S).

Run Synthesis (XST) from the Process panel.

Once synthesis completes successfully →
Right-click View RTL Schematic to visualize the design.

Step 4: Simulate the Design (Testbench)

Switch to the Simulation View (top left dropdown).

Right-click the project → New Source → VHDL Test Bench → Next.

Give a name (e.g., and_gate_tb.vhd) → Select your main module → Next → Finish.

Open the testbench file and write test vectors.

Example:

architecture behavior of and_gate_tb is
  signal A, B, Y : STD_LOGIC;
begin
  UUT: entity work.and_gate port map(A => A, B => B, Y => Y);

  process
  begin
    A <= '0'; B <= '0'; wait for 10 ns;
    A <= '0'; B <= '1'; wait for 10 ns;
    A <= '1'; B <= '0'; wait for 10 ns;
    A <= '1'; B <= '1'; wait for 10 ns;
    wait;
  end process;
end behavior;


Save → Click Check Syntax.

Run Simulate Behavioral Model using ISim.
→ Observe waveform output and verify logic.

Step 5: Add Constraints (UCF File)

Switch back to Implementation View.

Right-click → New Source → Implementation Constraints File (UCF) → Next.

Name it (e.g., and_gate.ucf) → Finish.

Open the .ucf file and assign pin locations according to your FPGA board.

Example:

NET "A" LOC = "P11";
NET "B" LOC = "P12";
NET "Y" LOC = "P15";


Save the file.

Step 6: Implement and Generate Bit File

In Implementation View, right-click Implement Design → Run.

After successful implementation →
Run Generate Programming File.

You’ll get a .bit file (used to program the FPGA).

Step 7: (Optional) FPGA Programming

Connect the Spartan-6 kit via USB.

Open iMPACT (Xilinx Tool).

Load the .bit file.

Configure the device → Verify successful programming.
